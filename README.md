## 🔬 Experiments Overview

### 1️⃣ Experiment 1: Simple Linear Regression
**Objective:** Predict Sales based on TV Marketing budget.
- **Model:** Simple Linear Regression ($y = mx + c$)
- **Dataset:** `sales_tv_marketing.csv`
- **Key Metrics:** $R^2$ Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### 2️⃣ Experiment 2: Multiple Linear Regression
**Objective:** Predict CO2 Emissions of vehicles based on features like Engine Size, Cylinders, and Fuel Consumption.
- **Model:** Multiple Linear Regression
- **Dataset:** `car_co2_emission.csv`
- **Highlights:**
  - 📊 Correlation Heatmap
  - 📦 Outlier Detection (Box Plots)
  - 📉 Scatter Plots for Feature Relations

### 3️⃣ Experiment 3: Logistic Regression
**Objective:** Predict whether a user will click on an online advertisement.
- **Model:** Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)
- **Dataset:** `ad_click_prediction.csv`
- **Key Features:**
  - 🧹 **EDA:** Missing value treatment, Data Normalization.
  - 🕒 **Feature Engineering:** Extracted 'Hour' from Timestamp to analyze time-of-day impact.
  - 📈 **Evaluation:**
    - Confusion Matrix
    - ROC Curve & AUC
    - Precision-Recall Curve
